# Variational Bayes for NMR

A framework for approximate Bayesian inference from off-grid, non-uniformly,
non-simultaneously sampled multidimensional NMR data.

This **vbnmr** library is a bespoke implementation of Variational Feature
Regression (VFR) for the multidimensional NMR signal model, specifically
aimed at active nonuniform sampling (Active NUS). The details of VFR are
in preparation for submission as:

> Worley, B., Nilges, M., Malliavin, T. E., _Variational Features for
> Regression and Classification_, Journal of Machine Learning Research,
> 2017.

A more general implementation of VFR is maintained in the
[VFL GitHub repository](http://github.com/geekysuavo/vfl).
